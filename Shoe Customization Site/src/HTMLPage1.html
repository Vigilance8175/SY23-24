    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Austin Axlund, Keelan Wheeler, and Evan Henrickson met in a college software programming class. They bonded over each other’s shoe collections but quickly came to the conclusion that there was not a shoe company with a capable website to customize shoes completely. This led to the three banding together and starting their own shoe company called Sneaky Sneakers. At first there was not much traction, until a famous influencer(shown below) on TikTok made a video describing Sneaky Sneakers and their mission to give a fully customizable experience when creating a shoe. This would propel Sneaky Sneakers to where they are today in their monopolization of the shoe industry today. If you want in, buy a sneaky sneaker!</p>
